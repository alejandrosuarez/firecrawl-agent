Scrape

Turn any url into clean data

Firecrawl converts web pages into markdown, ideal for LLM applications.

    It manages complexities: proxies, caching, rate limits, js-blocked content
    Handles dynamic content: dynamic websites, js-rendered sites, PDFs, images
    Outputs clean markdown, structured data, screenshots or html.

For details, see the Scrape Endpoint API Reference.

Extract structured data
â€‹
/scrape (with extract) endpoint

Used to extract structured data from scraped pages.

from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

# Initialize the FirecrawlApp with your API key
app = FirecrawlApp(api_key='your_api_key')

class ExtractSchema(BaseModel):
    company_mission: str
    supports_sso: bool
    is_open_source: bool
    is_in_yc: bool

data = app.scrape_url('https://docs.firecrawl.dev/', {
    'formats': ['extract'],
    'extract': {
        'schema': ExtractSchema.model_json_schema(),
    }
})
print(data["extract"])

Output:
JSON

{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "extract": {
        "company_mission": "Train a secure AI on your technical resources that answers customer and employee questions so your team doesn't have to",
        "supports_sso": true,
        "is_open_source": false,
        "is_in_yc": true
      },
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Mendable",
        "description": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",
        "robots": "follow, index",
        "ogTitle": "Mendable",
        "ogDescription": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",

        "ogLocaleAlternate": [],
        "ogSiteName": "Mendable",
        "sourceURL": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/"
      },
    }
}

Extracting without schema (New)

You can now extract without a schema by just passing a prompt to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.

curl -X POST https://api.firecrawl.dev/v1/scrape \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/",
      "formats": ["extract"],
      "extract": {
        "prompt": "Extract the company mission from the page."
      }
    }'

Output:
JSON

{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "extract": {
        "company_mission": "Train a secure AI on your technical resources that answers customer and employee questions so your team doesn't have to",
      },
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Mendable",
        "description": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",
        "robots": "follow, index",
        "ogTitle": "Mendable",
        "ogDescription": "Mendable allows you to easily build AI chat applications. Ingest, customize, then deploy with one line of code anywhere you want. Brought to you by SideGuide",
        "ogUrl": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/",
        "ogImage": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/mendable_new_og1.png",
        "ogLocaleAlternate": [],
        "ogSiteName": "Mendable",
        "sourceURL": "https://docs.firecrawl.dev/"
      },
    }
}

    schema: The schema to use for the extraction.
    systemPrompt: The system prompt to use for the extraction.
    prompt: The prompt to use for the extraction without a schema.

â€‹
Interacting with the page with Actions

Firecrawl allows you to perform various actions on a web page before scraping its content. This is particularly useful for interacting with dynamic content, navigating through pages, or accessing content that requires user interaction.

Here is an example of how to use actions to navigate to google.com, search for Firecrawl, click on the first result, and take a screenshot.

It is important to almost always use the wait action before/after executing other actions to give enough time for the page to load.
â€‹
Example

from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp

app = FirecrawlApp(api_key="fc-YOUR_API_KEY")

# Scrape a website:
scrape_result = app.scrape_url('firecrawl.dev', 
    params={
        'formats': ['markdown', 'html'], 
        'actions': [
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "click", "selector": "textarea[title=\"Search\"]"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "write", "text": "firecrawl"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 2000},
            {"type": "press", "key": "ENTER"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},
            {"type": "click", "selector": "h3"},
            {"type": "wait", "milliseconds": 3000},
            {"type": "screenshot"}
        ]
    }
)
print(scrape_result)
